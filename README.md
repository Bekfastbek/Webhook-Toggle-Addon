Basic addon for my personal use but feel free to use it 
Uses: It creates a !webhook command which enables/disables webhooks in an instant (It checks for adminRoleIds to prevent anyone to access except for whitelisted admin roles)
Its just a security command for the paranoid people who are afraid that their bot token might get leaked and would cause a server raid (it wont prevent that but it will make the raids less damaging since they wont be able to use webhooks to spam) just make sure to give manage webhooks permission for only a few seconds either through role settings or through a bot
